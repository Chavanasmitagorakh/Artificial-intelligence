## 🛠 Algorithms Explained

### 1. 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

- **Concept**: Mimics the way biological neurons work. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) where each node applies a mathematical function to its inputs.  
- **Architecture**: Input Layer → Hidden Layers → Output Layer  
- **Applications**:  
  - Predicting outcomes based on structured/tabular data  
  - Classification and regression problems  
  - Credit scoring, disease prediction, stock forecasting  
- **Libraries Used**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`  
- **Feature**:  
  - Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid  
  - Backpropagation with gradient descent  
  - Visualization of training loss/accuracy

### 2. 🖼️ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Concept**: Specialized neural network designed for processing grid-like data such as images. It automatically extracts spatial features using convolutional layers.  
- **Architecture**: Convolution Layers → Pooling Layers → Flatten → Dense Layers  
- **Applications**:  
  - Image classification (e.g., handwritten digit recognition)  
  - Object detection, facial recognition, medical imaging  
- **Libraries Used**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Matplotlib`  
- **Feature**:  
  - Convolution and pooling layers for feature extraction  
  - Visualization of training accuracy and loss  
  - Tested on image datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10
