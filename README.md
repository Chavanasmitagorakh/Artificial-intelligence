🛠 Algorithms Explained
1. 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Concept: Mimics the way biological neurons work. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) where each node applies a mathematical function to its inputs.

Architecture: Input Layer → Hidden Layers → Output Layer

Applications:

Predicting outcomes based on structured/tabular data

Classification and regression problems

Credit scoring, disease prediction, stock forecasting

Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Feature:

Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid

Backpropagation with gradient descent

Visualization of training loss/accuracy

2. 🖼️ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Concept: Specialized neural network designed for processing grid-like data such as images. It automatically extracts spatial features using convolutional layers.

Architecture: Convolution Layers → Pooling Layers → Flatten → Dense Layers

Applications:

Image classification (e.g., handwritten digit recognition)

Object detection, facial recognition, medical imaging

Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib

Feature:

Convolution and pooling layers for feature extraction

Visualization of training accuracy and loss

Tested on image datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10

3. 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Concept: NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of text data.

Architecture: Tokenization → Embedding (Word2Vec, TF-IDF, etc.) → Model (RNN/LSTM/Transformer) → Output

Applications:

Sentiment analysis and text classification

Chatbots and conversational AI

Machine translation, text summarization

Named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech tagging

Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Feature:

Preprocessing text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Word embeddings and vectorization techniques

Sequence models like RNN, LSTM, and Transformer

Visualization of model performance and word frequency
